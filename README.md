## Conclusion of Muniba e-shop marketplace :

On Day 1 of our eCommerce marketplace journey, we laid the foundation by understanding the essentials of eCommerce, Q-Commerce, and rental eCommerce. We explored the significance of building an online marketplace, the core functionalities required, and the benefits it offers in terms of scalability, convenience, and profitability.

For **Muniba e-Shop**, the goal is to provide affordable furniture and related products, addressing the challenge of accessibility and affordability in the market. The marketplace will feature products such as chairs, tables, sofas, vases, and crockery items.

To establish a structured foundation, we outlined a data schema defining key entities like **Products, Orders, Customers, Delivery Zones, Shipments, and Payments**, ensuring smooth marketplace operations. Relationships between these entities were mapped to facilitate efficient order processing, inventory management, and customer interactions.

This structured approach sets the stage for the next steps in developing a robust, scalable, and user-friendly eCommerce platform. ðŸš€


On Day 2 of the hackathon, we established the **technical foundation** for **Muniba e-Shop**, focusing on the essential system architecture and integrations required for a seamless eCommerce experience.

The **frontend**, built with **Next.js**, ensures a user-friendly and responsive shopping experience. Key pages include **Home, Login/Signup, Product Details, Cart, Checkout, and Order Confirmation**, with a 404 error page for missing routes. The UI incorporates **ShadCN-UI** components to enhance usability.

For the **backend**, we utilize **Sanity CMS** to manage products, orders, and customer data, structuring schemas to support efficient data retrieval and storage.

We also integrated **third-party APIs**, including **ShipEngine** for real-time shipment tracking and **Stripe** for secure payment processing, ensuring smooth order management.

The system architecture follows a clear workflow:
1. Users browse and add products to their cart.
2. Orders are recorded in **Sanity CMS**.
3. Shipments are tracked via third-party APIs.
4. Payments are securely processed using **Stripe**.
5. Customers receive real-time order updates.
6. Use clerk authentication for user signup/sign in specially for cart page.

This structured approach lays a solid foundation for **Muniba e-Shop**, ensuring scalability, reliability, and an enhanced shopping experience. ðŸš€

On **Day 3** of the **Muniba e-Shop** development, we focused on **API integration and data migration** to ensure seamless data flow between the provided API and **Sanity CMS**.

### Key Accomplishments:
- **API Testing & Validation**: The given API (`https://hackathon-apis.vercel.app/api/products`) was tested using Thunderstorm.
- **Schema Adjustments**: Modified the existing **Sanity CMS schema** to match API data, including:
  - Replacing **id** with **slug** for better URL handling.
  - Adding **price_id** for Stripe payment integration.
- **Data Import & Migration**:
  - Implemented an **importData.mjs** script to fetch and store data in Sanity.
  - Created a **deleteProduct.mjs** script to clear outdated data when necessary.

By completing this integration, **Muniba e-Shop** now has a structured, automated pipeline for managing product data efficiently, paving the way for a **fully functional eCommerce experience**. ðŸš€


On **Day 4** of **Muniba e-Shop**, we successfully developed **dynamic frontend components** powered by **Sanity CMS** to enhance the user experience.

### Key Achievements:

- **Checkout Integration**: Implemented **Stripe checkout** for secure transactions.

### Challenges Faced:
1. **Category Filtering**: Initially filtered by **slug**, later corrected to **name-based filtering**.
2. **Pagination in Dynamic Routes**: Faced difficulties in implementing pagination but successfully integrated it into the product detail page.

By overcoming these challenges, we have built a **fully functional, dynamic frontend** that efficiently renders content from **Sanity CMS**, bringing us closer to a complete eCommerce experience. ðŸš€
